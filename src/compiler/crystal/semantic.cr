# The overall algorithm for semantic analysis of a program is:
# - top level: declare classes, modules, macros, defs and other top-level stuff
# - new methods: create `new` methods for every `initialize` method
# - type declarations: process type declarations like `@x : Int32`
# - check abstract defs: check that abstract defs are implemented (PARALLEL under preview_mt)
# - restrictions augmenter: augment method type restrictions
# - instance_vars_initializers (InstanceVarsInitializerVisitor): process initializers like `@x = 1`
# - class_vars_initializers (ClassVarsInitializerVisitor): process initializers like `@@x = 1`
# - main: process "main" code, calls and method bodies (the whole program).
# - cleanup: remove dead code and other simplifications
# - check recursive structs (RecursiveStructChecker): check that structs are not recursive (PARALLEL under preview_mt)
#
# Parallelism status: AbstractDefChecker and RecursiveStructChecker are parallelized
# under `preview_mt` (Phase 5). All other sub-phases are sequential. The MainVisitor
# (sub-phase 8) is the primary bottleneck (~40-50% of compile time) and requires
# research-grade architectural changes to parallelize (see IC_PHASE_7_SEMANTIC.md).
# See `SemanticPhaseCoordinator` for detailed parallelism analysis of each sub-phase.
